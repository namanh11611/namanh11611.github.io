By reading blogs from software engineers at major companies, you can see how they &lt;strong>solve the problems&lt;/strong> they&amp;rsquo;ve encountered. In the age of AI, with tools like &lt;strong>Copilot&lt;/strong> or &lt;strong>Tabnine&lt;/strong> ready to generate code to support you, engineers are no longer distinguished by their ability to &lt;strong>remember the syntax of a language or framework&lt;/strong>, but by their &lt;strong>problem-solving skills&lt;/strong>. So, in this article, I will introduce you to the blogs of major companies, hoping you will gain some interesting perspectives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can click on the title of each section to go to the blog.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="meta">&lt;a class="link" href="https://engineering.fb.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Meta&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Meta&lt;/strong> (formerly known as &lt;strong>Facebook&lt;/strong>) has many products like Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp&amp;hellip; On this blog, they share about everything from Android, iOS, Web to more challenging topics like VR/AR or AI.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="google">&lt;a class="link" href="https://developers.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Google&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>On this homepage, you can choose one of four areas you are interested in: &lt;strong>Mobile&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>Web&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>AI&lt;/strong>, or &lt;strong>Cloud&lt;/strong>. Google will then introduce you to detailed articles in that field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Google also creates many courses about their technologies. Each course includes videos, detailed explanatory articles, and example exercises for you to follow. When you finish, you can earn a small badge. Quite fun!&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="netflix">&lt;a class="link" href="https://netflixtechblog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Netflix&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>In recent years, Netflix has become a household name as a platform for movies and TV shows. Instead of just &lt;em>Netflix and chill&lt;/em>, try reading their blog to see how they build a system that serves millions of users.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="dropbox">&lt;a class="link" href="https://dropbox.tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Dropbox&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>Similar to Google Drive, Dropbox is a cloud storage service that helps you store files online and sync them across devices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Through their blog, you can learn how to optimize memory and bandwidth when sharing files.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="twitter">&lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Twitter&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;Design a system like Twitter&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong> is a classic question in &lt;strong>System Design&lt;/strong> interviews. So, Twitter&amp;rsquo;s blog is a useful reference when preparing for interviews. You can see if your ideas match how Twitter actually does things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently, after being acquired by Elon Musk, Twitter even open-sourced their &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/twitter/the-algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;strong>Recommendation Algorithm&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="uber">&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.uber.com/en-IN/blog/engineering" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Uber&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>Although Uber has left the Vietnamese market after merging with Grab, it is still &lt;strong>the largest taxi company in the world&lt;/strong>. Therefore, their blog is very suitable for those working in companies with &lt;strong>similar business areas&lt;/strong> in Vietnam.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="spotify">&lt;a class="link" href="https://engineering.atspotify.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Spotify&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>I remember when Spotify first launched in Vietnam, everyone was amazed by its recommendation capabilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Spotify&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong>recommender system&lt;/strong> is a complex system, combining many &lt;strong>algorithms&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Machine Learning models&lt;/strong>. Through this blog, hopefully you will discover part of that system.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="line">&lt;a class="link" href="https://engineering.linecorp.com/en/blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>LINE&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>LINE is one of my former companies. Although it may not be as top-tier as the others above, the sharing culture is very strong. So, through this article, I want to introduce you to the technical blog of engineers at LINE.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
