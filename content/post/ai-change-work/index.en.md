# Will AI Replace Developers Soon?

Many people have asked me whether AI is about to replace developers. My answer, as of now, is **NO**. There still needs to be someone to **verify** the code that AI produces.

However, the tech industry evolves rapidly. Technologies that are **hot** today might become obsolete tomorrow. For example, six years ago when I graduated, coding for **Android** was primarily done using **Java**. But now, if you only know **Java** without **Kotlin**, it’s incredibly difficult to find a job.

So, will AI replace developers in the next **5 years** or **10 years**? I can’t say for certain.

# AI is Changing the Way We Work

That said, it’s clear that AI is transforming **how we work**.

In the past, a developer’s primary job was to convert **requirements** and **designs** into **code**. Tech leads and seniors would spend additional time in meetings to clarify requirements, but junior developers spent most of their time coding. It could take **months** or even **years** to deliver a product.

Recently, I’ve been working on a **new personal project**. Today marks **day 10**, but with the help of **Cursor**, the code I’ve written or directly modified accounts for just **5%**.

In the past, using **ChatGPT**, you could only generate small components and then copy them into your project. Even then, you’d need to spend a lot of time fixing them to fit. But with **Cursor**, it’s different. It understands the **project context**. By providing it with a **base project** and some **pre-written files**, it can replicate **99%** of the format, and the code is almost ready to use with little or no modifications.

Cursor acts as an **AI Agent**: after generating code, it even creates new files, runs the project to check for errors, and fixes them automatically before asking me to **review the changes**.

My role now resembles that of a **technical lead**: I **define tasks for Cursor**, review its output, and ask it to fix anything suboptimal. Once I’m satisfied, I merge the code.

But to **review AI-generated code**, you must understand **what each line means** and identify what isn’t optimized so you can instruct it to make corrections. Blindly applying AI-generated solutions can be risky. If bugs arise later, you may not know how to fix them.

# The Reality

Currently, a barrier to adoption in **large companies** is their hesitation to use AI due to **data security concerns**. Additionally, their **codebases** are vast, and using general AI tools to train on them can be **token-intensive**. AI has limitations in the **number of tokens it can retain**.

For me, AI isn’t much help in my company projects. However, for **small companies** or **indie hackers**, these barriers are less significant, creating opportunities to **accelerate software development**. Imagine cutting down the time to build an **MVP** from **months** to just **weeks**, or even **days**.

The numbers don’t lie—traffic to **StackOverflow** is declining. Developers are now asking **AI** for help more often than they use **Google**.

Returning to the question at the start: if a team once required **3 seniors and 7 juniors**, but after adopting AI, productivity improves and the team now only needs **3 seniors and 4 juniors**, hasn’t AI effectively **replaced 3 juniors**? More accurately, those who effectively leverage AI are taking over the roles of those who don’t.

# Conclusion

As the new year begins, I’m reflecting on my work so that future me can look back on this. During the **First Industrial Revolution**, machines replaced humans in **tedious manual labor**, freeing us to focus our intellect on other tasks. Let’s see where AI will take us in the next **5 years** or **10 years**.
