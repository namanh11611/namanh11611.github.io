Besides learning through tutorials and videos, **technical blogs** are a great resource. By reading blogs from software engineers at major companies, you can see how they **solve the problems** they've encountered. In the age of AI, with tools like **Copilot** or **Tabnine** ready to generate code to support you, engineers are no longer distinguished by their ability to **remember the syntax of a language or framework**, but by their **problem-solving skills**. So, in this article, I will introduce you to the blogs of major companies, hoping you will gain some interesting perspectives.

You can click on the title of each section to go to the blog.

# [Meta](https://engineering.fb.com)

**Meta** (formerly known as **Facebook**) has many products like Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp... On this blog, they share about everything from Android, iOS, Web to more challenging topics like VR/AR or AI.

# [Google](https://developers.google.com)

On this homepage, you can choose one of four areas you are interested in: **Mobile**, **Web**, **AI**, or **Cloud**. Google will then introduce you to detailed articles in that field.

Google also creates many courses about their technologies. Each course includes videos, detailed explanatory articles, and example exercises for you to follow. When you finish, you can earn a small badge. Quite fun!

# [Netflix](https://netflixtechblog.com)

In recent years, Netflix has become a household name as a platform for movies and TV shows. Instead of just *Netflix and chill*, try reading their blog to see how they build a system that serves millions of users.

# [Dropbox](https://dropbox.tech)

Similar to Google Drive, Dropbox is a cloud storage service that helps you store files online and sync them across devices.

Through their blog, you can learn how to optimize memory and bandwidth when sharing files.

# [Twitter](https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us)

**"Design a system like Twitter"** is a classic question in **System Design** interviews. So, Twitter's blog is a useful reference when preparing for interviews. You can see if your ideas match how Twitter actually does things.

Recently, after being acquired by Elon Musk, Twitter even open-sourced their [**Recommendation Algorithm**](https://github.com/twitter/the-algorithm).

# [Uber](https://www.uber.com/en-IN/blog/engineering)

Although Uber has left the Vietnamese market after merging with Grab, it is still **the largest taxi company in the world**. Therefore, their blog is very suitable for those working in companies with **similar business areas** in Vietnam.

# [Spotify](https://engineering.atspotify.com)

I remember when Spotify first launched in Vietnam, everyone was amazed by its recommendation capabilities.

Spotify's **recommender system** is a complex system, combining many **algorithms** and **Machine Learning models**. Through this blog, hopefully you will discover part of that system.

# [LINE](https://engineering.linecorp.com/en/blog)

LINE is one of my former companies. Although it may not be as top-tier as the others above, the sharing culture is very strong. So, through this article, I want to introduce you to the technical blog of engineers at LINE.
